# deep-and-wide-bandit
<br>
* Test_space_bandits.ipynb - Load the data snippet and run space-bandits <br>
* Test_wide_and_deep.ipynb - Create a very simple wide and deep model and train it on toy_problem from space-bandits <br>
* contextual_dataset_wu.py and toy_problem_wu.py - Copied from space-bandits and modified to handle/generate user IDs. Use with Test_wide_and_deep.ipynb <br><br>
* MAB_ToyExamples folder - MultiArm Bandits toy examples with epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson sampling <br>
* DataExploration folder - Exploratory data analysis notebook <br><br>
* deep_and_wide_model_demo folder - demo.py is a nicer version of Test_wide_and_deep.ipynb. You can more easily test the wide, deep, and wide+deep models, with three pre-trained models. Also needs the contextual_dataset_wu.py and toy_problem_wu.py files. <br><br>
* data_snippet_deep_wide.ipynb - Runs the simple deep and wide model (same model as demo.py) on our data snippet. <br>
